# Flutter Plants E-Commerce App (Plantify)

## Overview

In this 3rd project we were tasked with making an E-commerce plants app, with UI/UX and logic, here we'll see each page and its functionalties.

## HomePage
As we can see here, this is the main page the user is introduced to.

In this page the user is able to filter plants by indoor, outdoor, or all plants.

The user can also search, using a plant's name, by typing the search criteria and clicking on the search icon.

The user can interact with the plant cards, by adding them to their favorite list, or adding it to the cart, which will give the user a dynamic message based on their input, for example, when the user adds the item for  the first time, they get a message telling them its added to the basket, if they add it again, it will tell them how many plants of this one they have in the basket, or even in the saved list if they moved it there.

## Basket Page
This is the page with the most functionalties, the user can view their plants, wether they're in their actual basket or saved for later, the user can increase or decrease the number of each individual plant item, remove it entirely or move it between basket and saved list (which will not count its price), with dynamic messages for each situation. and finally the total amount is rounded for a better user experience.
